# Introduction
CarMinder is a web app that helps car owners estimate their next car maintenance date.
It is a full-stack web application that allows users to create an account, add their cars, and estimate maintenance dates.
If you are over caring for your car, CarMinder helps you not miss an important oil change, tires check, etc.

# Dev Goals
Although the app idea is fun to have in real life, the main goal of this project is to practice full-stack development.
The project is built using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend.
